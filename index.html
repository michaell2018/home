		<h2>Quick History</h2>
		<p>The history of sushi began around the 8th century in Japan. The original type of sushi was first developed in Southeast Asia as a means of 
		preserving fish in fermented rice. As time passed, people began to eat the rice as well as the fish. Even later, vinegar was used to sour 
		the rice. Today, it is an early form of fast food strongly associated with the Japanese. You can go to
